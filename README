NAME
    RDF::Crypt - semantic cryptography

DESCRIPTION
    RDF-Crypt provides a variety of objects and methods for
    cryptographically manipulating (encrypting, decrypting, signing and
    verifying) RDF graphs using RSA and WebID.

    RDF-Crypt uses a role-based architecture. Classes like
    RDF::Crypt::Encrypter are in fact very slim wrappers around collections
    of roles. Most of the interesting behaviour is documented in the role
    modules.

SEE ALSO
    RDF::Crypt::Encrypter, RDF::Crypt::Decrypter, RDF::Crypt::Signer,
    RDF::Crypt::Verifier.

    Web::ID, RDF::ACL.
